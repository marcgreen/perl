# HOW TO GET THIS .t TO PASS
# 
# There were 7 files that had new potential problems identified.
# Some of them may be real, and some of them may be because this program
# isn't as smart as it likes to think it is.  You can teach this program
# to ignore the issues it has identified, and hence pass, by doing the
# following:
# 
# 1) If a problem is about a link to an unknown module or man page that
#    you know exists, re-run the command something like:
#       ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t --add_link MODULE man_page ...
#    (MODULEs should look like Foo::Bar, and man_pages should look like
#    bar(3c); don't do this for a module or man page that you aren't sure
#    about; instead treat as another type of issue and follow the
#    instructions below.)
# 
# 2) For other issues, decide if each should be fixed now or not.  Fix the
#    ones you decided to, and rerun this test to verify that the fixes
#    worked.
# 
# 3) If there remain potential problems that you don't plan to fix right
#    now (or aren't really problems),
#    run this test script by hand, using the following formula (on
#    Un*x-like machines):
#         cd t
#         ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t --regen
# 
#    That should cause all current potential problems to be accepted by
#    the program, so that the next time it runs, they won't be flagged.
#    For a few files, such as perltoc, certain issues will always be
#    expected, and more of the same will be added over time.  For those,
#    before you do the regen, you can edit
#    /home/marc/programming/gsoc/perl/t/porting/known_pod_issues.dat
#    and find the entry for the module's file and specific error message,
#    and change the count of known potential problems to -1.
